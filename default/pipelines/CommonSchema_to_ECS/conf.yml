        DO NOT USE THIS PACK IF:

        - you are sending data to Elastic and want to use any pre-built content out of the box, including Elastic Security.


        Why:

        - Elastic uses its parsers to not only extract fields but also to build the data schema to enable reading from this data. this means that while the data looks right in Elastic, it's not showing up in dashboards or on analytics.


        What to do instead:

        - Send data to Elastic datastreams without changing the shape of your data first. we recommend you use the Map_events_to_Datastreams pipeline
